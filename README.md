# SoftSell Landing Page

This is the landing page for the **SoftSell** project, designed to showcase the features of the product, provide information to potential customers, and allow users to get in touch through a contact form.

## Features Implemented

- **Responsive Design**: The landing page is fully responsive, meaning it works well on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
  
- **Hero Section**: Contains a large welcoming message with a call to action (CTA) button that guides users to the contact section.

- **Features Section**: Lists key features of the product using cards, with icons to make them visually appealing.

- **Contact Form**: A fully functional contact form where users can enter their name, email, company, and message. The form has validations in place and includes icons for better user experience.

- **Footer**: Contains links to Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and Contact Us, along with social media icons that link to the respective platforms.

- **Framer Motion Animations**: Added smooth animations for various elements of the page, such as the heading and contact form.

## Design Choices

- **Material UI**: I used Material UI for the UI components to ensure consistency and maintainability, as it provides pre-built and customizable components for common UI elements.
  
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for utility-based styling to maintain a flexible layout system and ensure the page is responsive across all devices.

- **Icons**: I used React Icons (instead of Material UI Icons) for a lightweight, customizable approach to integrating icons into the design.

- **Color Scheme**: The overall color scheme is dark, with **#121212** as the background and light text to ensure readability and focus on the content.

- **Animation**: I utilized Framer Motion for animating elements, which makes the page interactive and visually appealing.

## Future Enhancements
